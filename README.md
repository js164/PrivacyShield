# 🛡️ PrivacyShield

A project developed as part of the **Lab in Computer Security and Privacy (SoSe 2025)**, focused on building a privacy assistant in the form of a web or mobile application.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Privacy Assistance Tool** aims to empower users to better understand and manage their digital privacy. It offers both backend logic and a user-friendly frontend interface to analyze personal privacy practices and provide recommendations or alerts.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Analyze user needs and privacy concerns
- ✅ Design and implement a secure backend service
- ✅ Create an intuitive and accessible frontend interface
- ✅ Deliver a functional privacy assistant as a web or mobile app

## 🔧 Development Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Identify user expectations and privacy threat models
   - Define system specifications and data flow

2. **Back-End Development**
   - Develop RESTful APIs or services
   - Ensure secure data handling, processing, and storage

3. **Front-End Development**
   - Create a responsive and engaging user interface
   - Integrate backend with interactive components

## 📱 Features (Planned/Expected)

- Privacy awareness questionnaire
- Personalized privacy scores and feedback
- Real-time suggestions for improving digital privacy
- Transparency dashboard for data usage
- Legal rights & compliance information (e.g., GDPR)
- Improve user awareness of digital security and privacy practices
